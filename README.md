# python-ml-udacity

This is my repository which contains solved quizes from my machine learning course taken up at udacity.

I am sharing this repo because I want to improve my python skills and other machine learning skills.

If you have a better way please raise a PR or tweet me @itsdamslife on Twitter.com.

Let's learn and grow together.
